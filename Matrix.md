This C++ Matrix Calculator is a console-based application that allows users to perform basic matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition. 
It uses a class-based approach where each matrix is represented as an object with defined rows and columns. The program prompts the user to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices
and provides a simple menu-driven interface to choose the desired operation. It includes checks to ensure that operations are only performed when the matrix dimensions are 
compatible (e.g., for addition, both matrices must be the same size; for multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second).
The results are then displayed in a readable matrix format. This calculator is suitable for learning matrix manipulation, object-oriented programming in C++,
and performing basic linear algebra tasks.
